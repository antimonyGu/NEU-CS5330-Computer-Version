This project explores different functionalities of opencv, and implements different filters for images. In the process of implementing this project I consult TA, Professor's lecture notes, Online resources. This is my first time interaction with opencv, and I learned some foundation data types, opencv core libraries, opencv cmake environment setup. Overall, I think this project is very rewarding experiance for me. I learned how fancy images are generated.

The images are in resources folder of this project. Their prefix numbers represent the correspongding effects of each task.
